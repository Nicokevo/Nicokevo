### 🚀 About Me

I'm a Full Stack Developer and  QA Automation with over 3 years of real-world experience, working with technologies such as:

- Backend: **.NET, C#, SQL Server**
- Frontend: **Blazor, React, JavaScript**
- Testing: **Playwright (TypeScript), Postman, xUnit, Jest**

I currently work in a **mid-level technical QA role**, combining software development and test engineering. I lead automation efforts using Playwright and Postman, validate APIs, perform manual code reviews, and actively collaborate on **Blazor and .NET-based systems**. My work bridges development and QA, aligning closely with the **SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test)** mindset.

My goal is to keep growing into a hybrid SDET/.NET Developer role, building high-quality systems with clean architecture, automation, and solid testing strategies.

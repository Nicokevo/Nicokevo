### 🚀 About Me

I'm a Full Stack Developer with over 3 years of real-world experience, working with technologies such as:

- Backend: **.NET, C#, SQL Server**
- Frontend: **React, Blazor, JavaScript**
- Testing: **Playwright (TypeScript), Postman, xUnit, Jest**

Currently, I work as a **Technical QA Engineer**, focusing on E2E automation and API testing. I write Playwright scripts, validate APIs using Postman, review pull requests, and collaborate closely with the development team. I’m also frequently exposed to Blazor and C# code, and work actively with SQL Server.

My goal is to continue growing as a Full Stack Developer in modern .NET environments, following clean code principles and best practices.
